    <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
    <p>I wake up, do some laundry, get dressed, do my scripture study, and head off to church. This being the last fast Sunday of the semester, I wanted to go first, but Drew beat me to it. It's fun competing with roommates to be the first one on the stand, lol. My testimony was quite emotional but also eye-opening. I didn't go in with anything planned, so I just let everything pour out. What was eye-opening for me was the amount of scripture, quotes, or parables that just randomly popped into my mind and related back to my testimony. It's not a super big deal, but it just really testified to me how much I've grown because I can't say I would've been doing that a year ago. It's also something I've always wished I could do because it kinda feels like a superpower, haha. After that, I can't fathom how many people wanted to bear their testimony. Based on the length of the line, it's safe to say it was almost the entire ward, which was AWESOME. I love this ward and am definitely going to miss everyone in it. After we had the second hour, I hung out with Brock for a bit, did a couple of ministering interviews, talked with the Day fam over the phone for a bit, and then headed back to the dorm to study for the remainder of the evening.  </p>

    <p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
    <p>Back on the grind. I woke up for leg day and honestly left limping. It was a good workout all around, and then I finished clave raises and leg presses in a superset with a couple of football players. One of them was Kody Epps, and the others were one WR and CB, whose names I don't remember. I‚Äôll bump into them again so we‚Äôll get back to that. It was a good workout, but I'm probably never joining them again. I'd rather wait for the leg press machine myself than go through the pain my legs experienced the entire rest of the weekü´†. Anyway, once over, I took a shower, ate breakfast, and headed to work. Per usual, it was a busy shift. We then went to class, returned to the dorm for dinner and a nap, and went to FHE. It's been a hot minute since I have, but it was fun. I'm not as close to them as I'd like, but they're a fun group. They even surprised me with the plan for next week's activity; they reserved the BYU track for an FHE race activity. I didn't even know you could do that, but apparently they did. They did a little research on me and wanted me to attend FHE, so this was their way of getting me to attend. I agreed to do an 800m race with the roommates, so we'll see how that goes. </p>

    <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
    <p>This morning's workout went HARD. While watching Creed II during the workout, all the emotions from the recent weeks came together and carried towards an intense workout. We then went out to the weirdest form of snow (kinda like hail but in the form of snow pellets), did the usual responsibilities, and had a slow day at work. Like every Tuesday, there were no classes, so I studied the entire evening. Like I said last week, ain't no way I'm taking the foot off the gas pedal. </p>

    <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
    <p>We woke up, hit the gym, took a shower, ate some breakfast, and then went to work for a day of goodbyes. First, we said goodbye to Sister Bullock, who is serving in Thailand, and asked if I received my mission call every Tuesday since the moment she arrived. We then said goodbye to the yee-haw sister. Our final goodbyes were with the Gusher Gals; Soeur Hollis, and Soeur DeGroff. Soeur Hollis is serving in the Bridgetown, Barbados mission, and Soeur DeGrodd is serving in the Madagascar, Antananarivo mission, both French-speaking. They're definitely a companionship that made the shifts fun, and that I will miss; best of luck to you both!!üáßüáßüá≤üá¨ After that, this Australian elder decided to buy me a Brigham Brew's soda, and an Elder's glass bottle randomly exploded in his hand while I was checking him out, so yeah, lots of action and events at this shift. You never know what to expect at the MTC. </p>
    <p>I missed my religion class this time because I couldn't find a parking spot; Heritage parking is definitely the bestü´§. Because I had the extra time, I decided to make the scheduled call with my mom, and it went really well. I haven't really had a good conversation with her since before I had told her and my dad that I had decided to serve a mission, so since then, there have been a ton of praying every day at home, at church, and in the temple to soften her heart and allow the Spirit to guide my words in the conversation that would be had once she would be ready. I can surely say that is what happened. My mom and I are again on talking terms. Obstacles will continue to follow, but it's a step in the right direction, and I have faith that God will continue working on me and my family. Immediately upon the call ending, I longboard down to the JFSB for a BALLER lecture by Professor Drake. Afterward, I returned to the dorm to make dinner, do homework, and study for the rest of the night.  </p>

    <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
    <p>No gym this day. I decided to take a rest day because my legs were KILLING me. The workout might have been on Monday, but this one was going to take a little longer to recover from. I'd rather recover than risk an injury. The work shift was pretty dead for the most part, aside from a surprise reappearance from Soeur Hollis. Her departure time wasn't until 1:30 pm, so I got to see her one last time. After work, all I really did was study and do homework. Nothing more, nothing less. I would usually make a trip to SLC, but I've gained a grasp of information systems to the point where I can cruise through the class, which has opened up more time. </p>

    <p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
    <p>I got the extra rest that day again, so I went to work as soon as I woke up and ate breakfast. This day is a new foe or friend, lol. I was talking with a sister about football because she was wearing a Miami Dolphins sweater, and then she went, "Ewww," when I told her I was a fan of the Las Vegas Raiders, so now we have beef Not really, but it's just something funny from the shift. This day was also our Fun Friday of the month, so we got some pizza and super strange soda options. For context, on the last Friday of every month, the BYU and MTC store employees are rewarded with a treat. I was fine with the pizza, but I did not want the soda, so I left the "Chocolate Soda" on his desk. He, Annaleese, and I ended up trying it later in the day, and believe me, this did not taste like "Chocolate."ü§¢ After work, I went to the gym, returned to the dorm, took a shower, ate some dinner, watched some March Madness, and did some more studying. Nothing exciting, but I wanted to get ahead of the schedule since Saturday would be busy. For those wondering why I didn't go to Boise, I decided that the position wasn't what I was looking for and wouldn't work for my hours. After talking with the manager over the phone, the decision was imminent. Promptings surely come with blessings because, hours later, I was offered a remote internship position as a Marketing Analyst with Clearlink based here in Draper, UT. Marketing? I thought you were going into Finance? Well, you're right, but I'm also on a pathway to pursue a Master's in Business management with a focus on Marketing and Finance! I have years to go until then, but that's my goal right now. I'm still working out all the details, but it's sure looking like I'll have an internship this summerüòÅ.  </p>

    <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
    <p>I woke up, did some scripture study, and headed immediately to the Oquirrh Temple for an initiatory session. I thought I had never been in the area, but it all seemed familiar because it had been a little over a year since I had visited the area with the old group from last year. Sure brought back some memories. Anyways, the Oqurrih Temple; SUPER AWESOME. Having visited the Bountiful temple last week, I feel that most temples are small to me now, but this one is definitely one of my favorites! Because Jordan River was just down the street, I decided to do an endowment session there as well. It's a good thing I did, too, because it allowed me to reflect upon the Atonement in preparation for Easter! I love the temple!ü§ç  </p>
    <p>After the two sessions, it took a big chunk of my day, and all my friends had gone down south for either a camping trip in Zion or a field trip to some crystal mine, so I made a stop by the IMAX theatre in South Jordan to watch Godzilla x Kong: A New Empire. I'm a HUGE monsterverse fan so best believe I LOVED this movie. The fact that it was in an IMAX theater was just the cherry on top. The drive back to Orem was a quick one because I still need to hit the gym!! I arrived around 9 pm and finished my workout within the hour timeframe I had before VASA closed. We then returned to the dorm, made a quick dinner, played some video games my cousins for a bit, and headed to bed. </p>

    <p>Well, that's the email! I skipped the bonus section, which sucks, but we'll save it for next week if there is an email. I expect this will be a busy week with a general conference coming up, so if there is no email, that is why. I hope you all had a blessed Easter Sunday! </p>
