    <p>Hey everyone! I hope you've all had a great week. Sorry for getting this one out so late again; the workload has been picking up, and I don't expect it to slow down. </p>

    <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
    <p>I woke up, cleaned the room, ate breakfast, dressed, and headed to the Tanner building for church. I am not surprised it slipped my mind, but this day was the Ward Conference. It was good to talk to the Stake Presidency and hear their insights during sacrament and the second hour. After that, I spoke with the patriarch for a bit and then got to feast on some of Sister White's signature MEATBALLS. After a popular request, they made a return, and for good reason because they are buissin! She also made so much extra that she gave me two zip-lock bags worth to take home; thank you, Sister White! Once the linger longer ended, we returned to the dorm, ate dinner, and studied for the remainder of the evening. Not too much this day, but a good day overall.   </p>

    <p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
    <p>On Monday, we woke up for the gym, and I can not tell you guys how much I love switching to mornings again. Morning gym sessions before sunrise just hit differently, and by getting them out of the way, I have so much extra time left in the day after classes. Why I ever stopped?!? I have no clue, but I'm happy to be back in the routine. Anyway, this was a good leg day overall and another testament to the big jumps in strength I've experienced over the last couple of weeks. I returned to the dorm, showered, dressed, ate breakfast, and headed to work early. There were no stats lectures the entire week, so we had time to study and prepare for our midterm this week. The shift was an overall fun one. Shifts with Allison and Emma are always fun, and now, adding a fourth worker, Breighlyn, or, as I call her, Breigh Breigh, has made for a more fun time.  </p>
    <p>During the hours that followed, I went to my religion class, joined a Facetime call with the sales team, ate some dinner, did homework, studied for the remainder of the evening, and went to bed by 9:30 pm.</p>

    <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
    <p>This was quite the day. I woke up at 3:30 am, arrived at VASA at 4 am for opening time, returned to the dorm around 5:40 am, took a shower, ate breakfast, and studied for my accounting exam until 3 pm. It was easily the longest study session I've ever done for a rough 8ish hours, but that's what happens when you procrastinate. At 3:15 pm, I walk to the testing center and take my accounting midterm. Honestly, there wasn't a thing I didn't know. My 8-hour study session went crazy, and there hadn't really been much I had struggled with in the units tested; yet, I fell short of my goal. I scored an 80, which keeps me at a B+. I don't have to take the retake, which is a plus, but at the same time, I would have liked to score a minimum of 90. Discipline is something I gotta maintain and will hold leading up to finals; I'm not gonna have another 8-hour study session happen again because I should be able to space things out on the day of the exam; it's just a short review, and poised confidence of the results that I will produce. </p>
    <p>After the exam, the girl sitting next to me, who I noticed peeking over my shoulder, made small talk on the way back to Heritage. She was a cool girl, and she did ask for my number, but with the end of the semester nearing, my commitment as of now is to prepare myself for the mission and summer sales, so I've decided to scratch off dating until after the two years and focus on my current priorities. Okay, enough of that; when I arrived at my dorm, I made dinner, did some studying, and headed over for my friend / ministering sister's mission call, Mahie. She got called to the San Antonio, Texas, mission! For a Hawaiian gal, Texas sure fits her well, lol. As her ministering brother, I do have to do better so I promised to take them to Swig at some point. Soda ainâ€™t my thing but if her and her roommate (Grace) LOVE it and it makes for a good time, I can do it as a one time thing. When finished, I went back to the dorm, listened to a couple of conference talks, and headed to bed.</p>

    <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
    <p>I wake up, head to the gym, drive back, shower, eat breakfast, and head to work. That day, I worked from opening (9 am) to closing (5 pm), which made for a fun but also boring shift. After 1:30 pm, there aren't many missionaries who come in, and they're the ones who make it fun, so the remainder of that shift went by relatively slow and mostly consisted of cleaning and sorting boxes full of preaching my gospels.  </p>
    <p>Per finishing the shift, I received a call for my younger brother regarding his potential interest in joining my sales team this summer in Boise. The more the merrier! I called my close friend and sales team manager, Jake, and told him about the news. Coincidently enough, he was already planning to call me because we planned to meet two other potential recruits at a Korean restaurant at 7:15 pm. I did some homework and then made the trip to Chicken in the Kitchen to meet up with the guys. I added my brother to a call; we ate and had a good evening. All the guys have interest, but the question is whether they will sign on; fingers crossedðŸ¤ž. The day ended with me working on my VBA project and then heading to bed. </p>

    <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
    <p>This day was nothing, but VBA making my brain hurt. I woke up, went to the gym, got back, showered, ate breakfast, and went to work. I always forget that this is the day we get our shipment of candy, but Soeur (Sister) Hollis and DeGroff sure never do. I'm always minding my business, stocking stuff before opening, and then *KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*, Souer Hollis and DeGroff knocking on the window doors to wave hello. They always enter the building at 9 am, do their studies outside the store, and come in to purchase their Sour Gushers at opening. They come in multiple times a day as well because Soeur DeGroff always seems to get a package every day. Like, I'm not exaggerating this; it's an EVERYDAY thing, and they know itðŸ˜‚. To say the least, they're a fun companionship. After work, I worked on my VBA project the entire evening. I cannot exaggerate how much this project was messing with me, but thankfully, there was no class, and I got it done. It was not my best performance, but I still got an A, so I wasn't complaining. </p>

    <p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
    <p>Spring day. . . yayyyy. I was originally going to head to Zion with the crew this morning but decided to focus on catching up on my studies, work, gym, and meeting up with my sales team. I wake up, go to the gym, return for a quick shower and breakfast, and head to work. This shift was fairly chill because Fridays tend to be one of our slowest days, and Aidan, my look-alike and often mistaken brother and the only other guy who works at the MTC store, is a big help in making everything run quicker. I also bumped into Sister Strong, or as some of you back home might know her, Aika Strong. Sheâ€™s from Modesto and I didn't know her prior to her mission but apparently she knew who I am because of the stories sheâ€™s heard of me. Small world. When the shift ended, I went to my dorm to quickly review my sales pitch and then headed to Orem to meet with my team for a meeting. Informative meeting overall and easy $100 bonus with the memorized sales pitch. We ended around 5 pm and headed back to the dorm to study and apply to a ton of internships. I applied to maybe 50+ remote internships since that would be manageable during the summer, but we'll just play the waiting game to see if I land one within this next month.   </p>
    
    <a id="saturday"></a>
    <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
    <p>I wake up and go to the gym for what I would consider a lat day. It was a chest/back day, but I essentially tried every iteration of workouts that worked my lats to discover which workouts I liked best and because it has been a muscle group I've ignored. Lats being sore is something else; they are going crazy today. After the gym, I went to get a car wash and worked on my VBA midterm the entire evening. This one wasn't as bad as the VBA project, but it was still messing with me. No temple this week because of the business, so we'll most likely be doubling up this upcoming week.  </p>
    <p>No bonus section again this week. I'll try to do better and get it incorporated back into the email this next week. Regarding the mission call, I won't be getting it until conference week, most likely 04/9. I was told that because of my availability date, the stake can't submit my papers until the 9th because the submission date needs to be 150 days or less before my start. More wait time, but as Souer Hollis reminded me, it's God's timing. I need to be patient. Also, welcome to those recently added to the email list. We are now at 50+! This email list will translate to my mission email at some point, so do what you want with these emails; it's just easier for me to save the list in MailChimp.  </p>
       
    <p>I hope you all have a blessed week! </p>  
    <p>With love,</p>
