    <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
    <p>Undoubtedly, his workout this morning was the worst of the semester. I was exhausted and didn‚Äôt want to go to the gym but I went anyway. I wanted to leave VASA so badly but refused to until the workout was finished. One positive to take, however, was the triceps. Progress is being made, and the once-torn left tricep looks to be no more. After the gym, I went to the MTC for quite a boring shift. Tuesdays are super slow, and my co-worker also called out, so it was just me in the MTC store with little to nothing to do. I'm not complaining, though; I'll take the easy breadü§ë. After work, I took a nap and did homework the entire evening. It was not the production level I would have liked because I was still super tired from Sunday and Monday, but I got what needed to be done. </p>

    <!-- Anchor for Wednesday -->
    <a id="wednesday"></a>
    <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
    <p>There was a big difference compared to the last morning; this workout most definitely topped Mondays. So the workout is going üî•, and then I start talking with Craig, a local elderly guy who has lived his entire life in Orem. He's a super genuine guy who always likes to dive deep into talks. He asks me about my bench and I tell him I haven't hit 225 yet, but he has so much belief in me, has me do 255 on the bench machine for warm-up, and then hop onto the bench to try 225 right off the bat. Let's just say I HIT BABY!!üí™ It definitely made my day, especially since I was starting to think I wouldn't hit by the end of the semester. Thanks, Craig!! After the gym, I showered, ate some breakfast, and went to work. There were a lot of deep conversations with my co-workers this shift since that's the mood I was in, but we'll get to some of that stuff later. After work, I went to my religion class, walked Eve L. to Heritage, and went to the last accounting lecture of the semester. I'm definitely going to miss this class; Professor Drake is the best! If I wasn't taking Foundations of the Restoration with Bro. Griffith's; Accounting 200 with Drake would arguably be my favorite class this semester. When the lecture ended, I went up to Professor Drake to express my gratitude and then headed off to the dorm to make some dinner and do homework for the remainder of the evening. How much homework was actually done? I haven't a clue. I passed out around 8 pm and didn't wake up until the following morning. It was a tiring week, for sure. </p>

    <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
    <p>This day, I decided to call off from work to take care of some chores and finish the remainder of the semester's assignments. I went to the gym, showered, ate breakfast, went to Sam's Club to grab some things to prepare for Boise, and returned to the dorm. I finished all my homework around 7 pm, and I will say that it looks like spring has finally started in Utah!üòÜ It's been sunny since Thursday, and temperatures have been floating around the low 70s, which I haven't felt since probably late August. Another thing is this weather is kind of making me miss California a bit. It'll be my first time not spending the summer in California, and I don't expect Boise summers to compare to Cali's, but I'm super pumped. Summer sales will be a grind, but something I believe and know I can succeed in it, and I can't wait! It's going to be fun! T-minus two weeks‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è</p>

    <p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
    <p>Waking up this morning, I finally felt full of energy again. I went to the gym, showered, ate breakfast, went to my stats class, and went to work. Man, I was a goofball during this shift. During this shift, we also got the news that we'd be losing Coach Pope to Kentucky, sooo I guess we'll never get that Chom Burger, David. It's overrated anyway. After work, I went to the gym and stopped by the car wash. The car needed cleaning after the trip to Park City, and I needed to take advantage of the last days left on my subscription at Quick Quack. Boise doesn't have a Quick Quack, which is a big L in my booksüôÅ. Steven also seems to have eaten Maci's lucky pen. I assumed I would find it, considering the deep clean I always give my car, but it was nowhere in sight, so it's safe to say Steven ate it. Also, who's Steven?! Well, that's my car's name for the time being. I haven't figured out a better name, and Steven seems to fit, so we'll just leave it at Steven for now. Regarding my longboard and bike, well, I don't have a name yet, but shoot me ideas because, according to my classmates from accounting, I "should" have a name for all my rides.</p>
    <p>After the car wash, I drove to the Tanner building for our Sales meeting. Overall, it was a productive meeting. It was my first time leading a training, and it went much better than expected. When that was over, I drove back to the dorm, showered, did some homework, talked with my dad over the phone, went to my floor check-out meeting, and then headed to bed. </p>

    <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
    <p>The end of the week! I went to the gym, showered, ate breakfast, stopped by a couple of stores to see what the market for my monitor looked like, and stopped by Target for circle week. BYOMA's products were on sale, so I will try them because I'm kind of done paying Curology $125+ / month. The product works, but man, I have definitely been getting ripped off. I have to save my pennies where I can, lol. After that little Target adventure, I returned to the dorm, made dinner, worked on this email, studied, changed clothes, and drove up to Mount Timpanogos Temple. I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites, but I loved it! It's super pretty!üòç It reminded me a bit of the Bountiful Temple, and I would say it's comparable in size; not quite there, but close. After my session, I drove back to the dorm, made some finishing touches to this email, and went to bed.</p>

    <p><strong>Bonus Section</strong></p>
    <p>Okay, as promised, I'll be talking about my favorite talk from this last conference. When it came to this, it was super tough because they were all so incredible. I might mention bits and pieces of other talks, but let's get into it! My favorite was Elder Kearon's talk on God's Intent to Bring You Home. This one was a home run for me when I watched it in person, and I have probably either listened or rewatched it at least another five times since. The most significant point he alluded to is how Heavenly Father's plan is designed to bring all his children home, not to keep us out. He does not choose and pick who He wants to return to Him and who He doesn't; "He employs every possible measure to bring you back." Pausing here, these early words spoken by Him struck me hard. It caused me to reflect on my first semesters at BYU because they were a pain when it came to academics. I didn't perform poorly but didn't perform to the standard or passion for the material I was accustomed to. I was doing all the little things and asking Heavenly Father for help, but I received no answer for months. It felt like He was trying to drive me away from the church, and at some point, I even convinced myself of that. Fast forward to now, I'm no longer in that state of mind. My faith is on a much stronger foundation than ever before, and I have a better idea of the direction I want to take in life and the eternities. Like me, Heavenly provides all the resources to all His children that we need to succeed in this life and return to Him. In some circumstances, those resources may be harder to recognize, but they are always there because He loves us. He has no reason to put roadblocks before us that don't need to be there. </p>
    <p>Elder Kearon then continued his message by connecting it with the Atonement. Because of his atoning sacrifice, "every roadblock of physical and spiritual death that would separate us from our eternal home" is removed. ‚ÄúFor I came from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. (John 6:38)" Heavenly Father sent down His Only Begotten Son to partake of the bitter cup and make it possible for all His children to one day return. I then loved how he referred to the parable of the Lost Sheep. Like Heavenly Father, our Savior will search for all His lost sheep until He finds them because He wants us to return to Heavenly Father's kingdom one day. His infinite Atonement covers all of the Father's children; His arm is extended to everyone. "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. (John 14:18)" </p>
    <p>Well, those first two paragraphs kind of look like the start of talk, but oh wellü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Let me get into my thoughts after reflecting on them this week. It made me think a lot about my family and the point I am today in my life. Because Heavenly Father loves me so much, he gave me earthly parents. Without them, I can't say I'd be who I am today. As the weeks and months pass, I always draw on the lessons they taught me. If it weren't for them, there would be many moments in college thus far; I would've hit a dead end. That's not to say I haven't, but they've been minimized. I'm not perfect, lol. One from my Dad, for example, is, "It's not okay to be okay." It's a quote I've carried with me this semester and has motivated me to shoot for the top; there's no reason I can't or shouldn't. Another thing was the past, present, and future. This semester, when I've talked to people about my conversion story and they ask me how I got to the position I've got to, there's been a lot of "I have no clue" or "I wish I knew. I have no idea." It was through faith and the grace of God. Without my faith, I would not have continued lessons with the missionaries, attended seminary, gotten baptized, or out of the sixteen schools I was admitted to, chosen BYU as my next home. The same is to be said for where I currently stand with regard to all other aspects of my life (church, school, work, etc). Regarding the future, it took me into deep thought. All the resources to succeed are right in front of me; they've always been there. I've just been so distracted with other things that I never really acknowledged them. Whatever I choose to do, I know I'll be great. That's not just because of my confidence in myself but because of the faith I have Christ will help me get there. What type of Father and husband I want to be and where I would foresee myself ending up also popped into my thought process. I won't dive deep into this because it's something further down the line past the mission, but it is something I've found important to think about the closer and closer I get to that point. </p>
    <p>Sorry, I know that was a lot. For those of you who made it through that entire bonus section, cheers to yaü•Ç. Updates on the mission call: it should be coming in this Tuesday. I talked to my Stake President this Friday after he got off the phone with the mission office, and apparently, my call got reviewed three times. The first time, I got assigned and then unassigned, I got reviewed a second time and didn't get an assignment, and the third time, based on their records, I assigned to a mission. Who has a clue why my application got reviewed so many times, but I hope the third time was the charmü§û. Not that it matters either because I'm not planning to open it until after I finish finals next week, but I would like to know if I have it on hand when that day comes. Anyway, that's it! I hope you all have the bestest of weeks! Hopefully, this doesn't have as many typos as the last email; that's what happens when I rush it, lol. I love you guys!!ü´∂</p>
